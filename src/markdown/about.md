# About Me

My name is James Maddison. A recent graduate from [Aston University][]. I was
first introduced to programming through a game called [Blockland][]. A virtual
Lego world moddable through a C-style language known as [TorqueScript][]. I
progressed onto C++, tinkering with OpenGL before exploring other areas such as
the various web languages. I went on to enroll in a Bachelors of Science in
Computer Science at [Aston University][]. The course language was Java but I
also picked up a knowledge of other tools and languages such as Latex, MatLab,
Python and Lisp. My working environment became Linux using Vim as my main text
editor and I have never looked back since.

During my degree I did a year (and a bit) on placement at [MasterMagnets][], a
company who primarily manufacture and sell industrial separation magnets. I was
the sole developer with the responsibility of upgrading a piece of legacy
software written in [QBasic][]. This project was dubbed [MagWiz][]. The
program's original responsibility was to select the optimal and most competitive
magnet. By the end of the project [MagWiz][] was able to design magnets,
automatically produce part lists and generate prices as well as the original
selection.

For the final year of my degree part of the assessment was an [individual
project][1]. [MasterMagnets][] agreed to allow me to produce for them a piece of
software to simulate permanent magnets, producing contour plots to graphically
represent the magnet's strength in the surrounding area. In the short time that
the project was developed it was capable of modelling collections of arbitrary
cuboidal permanent magnets.

Despite there being a strong magnet theme throughout the last two years of my
degree I explored various other fields. Some modules I took and particularly
enjoyed include Multi-Agent Systems, Multimedia Information Retrieval and Image
and Video Processing.
