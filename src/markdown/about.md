# About Me

My name is James Maddison. A recent graduate from [Aston University][]. I was
first introduced to programming as a teenager through a game called
[Blockland][]. A virtual Lego world moddable through a C-style language known as
[TorqueScript][]. I started tinkering with C++ and OpenGL and exploring other
areas such as the web. I went on to enroll in a Bachelors of Science in Computer
Science at [Aston University][]. The course language was Java but I also picked
up a knowledge of other tools and languages such as MatLab, Python, LaTeX and
Lisp. I am a big lover of Linux and Vim.

During my degree I worked for just over a year on placement at
[MasterMagnets][], a company who primarily manufacture and sell industrial
separation magnets. I was the sole developer with the responsibility of remaking
a piece of legacy software written in [QBasic][]. The company was largely
dependent on the software for selecting the most competitive magnet.  With it
being built in QBasic in the 80s it could not run natively on modern machines
and didn't have even the most basic things such as mouse interaction. This
project was dubbed [MagWiz][].

For the final year of my degree part of the assessment was an [individual
project][1]. [MasterMagnets][] agreed to allow me to produce a piece of software
to simulate the magnetic field of a permanent magnets, producing contour plots
to graphically represent the magnet's strength in the surrounding area.
I creatively called this [permanent magnet modeller][1] or PMM for short. In the
short time that the project was developed it was capable of modelling
collections of arbitrary cuboidal permanent magnets.

Despite there being a strong magnet theme throughout the last two years of my
degree my module choices allowed me to explore various other fields. Some
modules I took and particularly enjoyed include Multi-Agent Systems, Multimedia
Information Retrieval and Image and Video Processing. I have now graduated with
a First Class Honours and am ready to being the next chapter of my life.
